// Simple 2 Wheel robot demonstrating the use of the ESP32 and the TB6612FNG Motor Controller

// This is a modified version of the sparkfun Dual Motor Controller TB6612FNG example sketch
// Which can be found here. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14450?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6LyfBhC3ARIsAG4gkF8E3EeZWggXUgO7oEWK2d7iwPDjHLctu7CT5xEef9ki6SXmh0vvJ7waAuB7EALw_wcB

// *** Wiring connections from TB6612FNG Motor Controller to the Motors ***

// Connect the leads from your motors, don't worry if you don't get them correct the first time
// Motor 1 should go to A01 and A02
// Motor 2 should go to B01 and B02
// If the motors are NOT turning in the right direction reverse the pins (for example the A01 and A02) pins
// If the left and right motors are reversed then swap the A01 and A02 wires to the B01 and B02 pins 

// *** Wiring connections from the Battery Pack to the ESP32 and TB6612FNG Motor Controller ***

// A 4 Cell battery pack was used to supply 6 Volts of DC current to the robot and to the ESP32
// A wire splitter was used to connect the Positive (+) side of the Battery pack to the VIN pin of the ESP32,
// and to the VM pin of the TB6612FNG Motor Controller.
// Another wire splitter was used to connect the Negative (-) side of the Battery pack to the GND pin of the ESP32,
// and to the GND pin of the TB6612FNG Motor Controller


// these constants are used to allow you to make your motor configuration
// line up with function names like forward.  Value can be 1 or -1
const int offsetA = 1;
const int offsetB = 1;

Motor motor1 = Motor(AIN1, AIN2, PWMA, offsetA, STBY,5000 ,8,1 );
Motor motor2 = Motor(BIN1, BIN2, PWMB, offsetB, STBY,5000 ,8,2 );

// Initializing motors.  The library will allow you to initialize as many
// motors as you have memory for.  If you are using functions like forward
// that take 2 motors as arguements you can either write new functions or
// call the function more than once.
